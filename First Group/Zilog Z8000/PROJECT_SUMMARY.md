# Zilog Z8000 - Project Summary

## Overview
Z80's 16-bit successor (1979). Technically excellent, commercially failed.

## Key Specifications
- **Registers:** 16 × 16-bit (orthogonal!)
- **Clock:** 4-10 MHz
- **IPC:** ~0.12

## Why It Failed
- Late to market (1979)
- No killer platform
- Z80 success made Zilog complacent
- 8086 had IBM PC, 68000 had Mac/Amiga

## Lesson Learned
Best technology ≠ market winner. Timing and ecosystem matter more.
