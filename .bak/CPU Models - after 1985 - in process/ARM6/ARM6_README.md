# ARM6 CPU Queueing Model

## Executive Summary
The ARM6/ARM610 (1991) is the **foundation of all modern ARM processors**. First ARM with 32-bit addressing, first designed for licensing, powered the Apple Newton. Every iPhone, every Android, every Apple Silicon Mac traces its lineage to ARM6.

## Technical Specifications
| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Year | 1991 |
| Address space | **32-bit** (first!) |
| Clock | 20-40 MHz |
| Pipeline | 3 stages |
| Transistors | 35,000 |
| Power | ~500 mW |

## Why ARM6 Matters

### First 32-bit Address Space
```
ARM2/ARM3: 26-bit address (64 MB max)
ARM6:      32-bit address (4 GB max)

This was essential for modern systems.
```

### First Licensing-Focused Design
```
ARM Ltd became independent in 1990.
ARM6 was designed from start for licensing.
This business model conquered the world.
```

### Apple Newton (1993)
```
Apple Newton MessagePad:
- ARM610 @ 20 MHz
- First ARM in Apple product
- Commercial failure

But 20 years later, ARM conquered Apple:
- iPhone (2007)
- iPad (2010)
- Apple Silicon Mac (2020)
```

## The ARM6 Lineage
```
ARM6 (1991) - Foundation
    ↓
ARM7 (1993) - Game Boy Advance
    ↓
ARM9 (1997) - Nintendo DS
    ↓
ARM11 (2002) - Original iPhone
    ↓
Cortex-A8 (2005) - iPhone 3GS
    ↓
Cortex-A9 (2007) - iPad
    ↓
Apple A-series (2010+)
    ↓
Apple M-series (2020+)

ALL modern ARM traces back to ARM6!
```

## Systems Using ARM6
- Apple Newton (1993)
- 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (1993)
- Acorn RiscPC (1994)
- Various embedded systems

## ARMv3 Architecture
ARM6 introduced ARMv3:
- 32-bit program counter
- Extended processor modes
- Undefined instruction trapping
- Foundation for all modern ARM ISA
