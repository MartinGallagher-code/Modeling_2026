# WDC W65C802 - Project Summary

## 65816 in 6502 Package (1984)

Bill Mensch's solution to the 6502 upgrade problem.

## Key Innovation
Take 65816 (16-bit, 64-pin) and put it in 40-pin package.
Same socket as 6502 = drop-in upgrade!

## Features
- 16-bit registers (in native mode)
- All 65816 instructions
- 100% 6502 compatible (emulation mode)
- Same 40-pin package as 6502

## Limitation
64 KB address space (vs 65816's 16 MB) due to 40-pin constraint.

## Still Available
WDC continues selling the W65C802 today.
