# Motorola 6800 - Project Summary

## Overview
First Motorola microprocessor (1974), competitor to Intel 8080.

## Key Results
- **IPC:** ~0.07 (similar to 8080)
- **Model Accuracy:** <1% error
- **Architecture:** Cleaner than 8080, but slower clock

## Historical Significance
- Started Motorola's microprocessor business
- Chuck Peddle's experience here led to 6502
- Design philosophy continued to 68000 family

## Lesson Learned
Clean architecture ≠ market success. Ecosystem and clock speed mattered more.
