# Intel iAPX 432 - Quick Start

## Intel's Famous Failure (1981)

The "micromainframe" that was 10× slower than 68000.

| Spec | 432 | 8086 |
|------|-----|------|
| Chips | **3** | 1 |
| MIPS | **0.16** | 0.60 |
| Result | FAILED | IBM PC |

## Why It Failed
1. Too slow (capability checking overhead)
2. Too complex (3-chip CPU)
3. Too expensive
4. Optimized for Ada (market wanted C)
5. No ecosystem

## Silver Lining
Lessons learned → successful 80386 design.

---
**The most ambitious failure in CPU history.**
