# NEC V20 - Project Summary

## Faster 8088 Clone (1984)

The NEC V20 was a pin-compatible 8088 replacement that ran 10-40% faster and included hardware 8080 emulation mode.

## Key Improvements
- **4.7× faster** 16-bit multiply
- **5× faster** divide
- Single-cycle barrel shifter
- Optimized string operations
- Hardware 8080 mode (run CP/M!)

## The Lawsuit
