# Intel 8008 - Project Summary

## The First 8-Bit Microprocessor (1972)

The Intel 8008 was the first 8-bit microprocessor, designed for Datapoint's 2200 terminal. When Datapoint rejected it as too slow, Intel kept the design and launched the microprocessor industry.

## Key Facts
- **Year:** 1972
- **Clock:** 500-800 kHz  
- **Address space:** 16 KB
- **Transistors:** 3,500
- **IPC:** ~0.04

## Major Limitations
- Only 7-level hardware stack (no recursion)
- Multiplexed bus required ~20 support chips
- Three voltage supplies needed (+5V, -9V, GND)
- Too slow for Datapoint's needs

## Historical Significance
- First 8-bit microprocessor ever made
- Register names (A,B,C,D,E,H,L) survive in x86 today
- Direct ancestor: 8008 → 8080 → 8086 → all modern x86

## The Irony
Datapoint could have owned microprocessor rights but took cash instead. Intel kept the chip and created a trillion-dollar industry.
