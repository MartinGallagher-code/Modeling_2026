# AMD Am2901 - Project Summary

## 4-Bit ALU Slice (1975)

Cascade multiple slices to build custom-width CPUs with your own instruction set.

## Concept
- 4 slices = 16-bit CPU
- 8 slices = 32-bit CPU
- You define the instructions via microcode

## Why Used
- Fastest technology available
- Custom instruction sets
- Used in VAX, Symbolics, arcade games

## Modeling Note
Different paradigm - performance depends on microcode design and system configuration.
