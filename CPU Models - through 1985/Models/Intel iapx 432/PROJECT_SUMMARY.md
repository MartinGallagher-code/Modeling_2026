# Intel iAPX 432 - Project Summary

## Intel's Biggest Failure (1981)

The iAPX 432 was Intel's ambitious "micromainframe" project - a capability-based, object-oriented processor intended to replace mainframes.

## The Problem
- **4-10× slower** than contemporary 8086/68000
- Required **3 chips** for CPU
- Optimized for Ada (market wanted C)
- Shipped late with no ecosystem

## Why Study It?
1. Proves complexity ≠ success
2. Capability architectures have overhead
3. Market timing matters
4. Lessons applied to 80386

## Legacy
Nearly bankrupted Intel. Only success of 8086/8088 in IBM PC saved the company.
