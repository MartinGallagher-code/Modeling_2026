# Intel 8096 - Project Summary

## 16-bit Automotive MCU (1982)

The dominant microcontroller for automotive engine control from mid-1980s through 2000s.

## Key Features
- 16-bit CPU with register file
- 8-channel 10-bit A/D converter
- High-Speed Input (HSI) for capture
- High-Speed Output (HSO) for timing
- Hardware multiply/divide
- PWM output

## Why Automotive
Perfect peripheral set for engine control: read sensors (A/D), capture crankshaft (HSI), fire spark/injectors (HSO), calculate fuel (multiply).

## Impact
Majority of automotive ECUs 1985-2005.
