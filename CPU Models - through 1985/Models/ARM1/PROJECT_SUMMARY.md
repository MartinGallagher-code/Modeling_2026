# ARM1 - Project Summary

## Overview
First ARM processor (1985). Beginning of the architecture that dominates mobile.

## Key Specifications
- **Transistors:** 25,000 (10× fewer than 80386!)
- **Clock:** 8 MHz
- **Pipeline:** 3 stages
- **Registers:** 16
- **IPC:** ~0.65

## Designers
Sophie Wilson (instruction set) and Steve Furber (hardware) at Acorn Computers.

## Revolutionary Features
1. Conditional execution on every instruction
2. Barrel shifter (free shift on second operand)
3. Load/store RISC architecture
4. Large register file (16 registers)

## Historical Significance
- First ARM processor (development only; ARM2 was production)
- Worked correctly on first silicon (rare!)
- Established efficiency-focused design philosophy
- DNA lives in billions of mobile devices today

## Legacy
ARM1 (1985) → iPhone (2007) → 250 billion ARM chips (2026)

## Files
- `arm1_model.py` - Python implementation
- `arm1_model.json` - Configuration
- `ARM1_README.md` - Full documentation
- `QUICK_START_ARM1.md` - Quick reference
