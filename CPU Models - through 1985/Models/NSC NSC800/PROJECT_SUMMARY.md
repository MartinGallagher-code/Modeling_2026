# NSC NSC800 - Project Summary

## Z80-Compatible, CMOS (1979)

National Semiconductor's Z80-compatible with CMOS process and 8080-like pinout.

## Key Features
- 100% Z80 software compatible
- CMOS (lower power)
- Static design (can stop clock)
- Single-phase clock

## Not Pin-Compatible!
Uses 8080-like pinout, not Z80 pinout. Requires board redesign.

## Significance
Shows Z80 architecture was valuable enough for multiple implementations.
