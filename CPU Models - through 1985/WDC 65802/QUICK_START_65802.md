# WDC W65C802 - Quick Start

## 65816 in 6502 Package (1984)

**The upgrade path for 6502 systems!**

| Chip | Package | Address | Registers |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 6502 | 40-pin | 64 KB | 8-bit |
| **65802** | **40-pin** | 64 KB | **16-bit!** |
| 65816 | 64-pin | 16 MB | 16-bit |

## Key Idea
Same CPU core as 65816, but in 40-pin package.
Drop into 6502 socket = instant 16-bit upgrade!

## Two Modes
- **Emulation**: Acts like 6502 (compatible)
- **Native**: Full 16-bit power

Still available from WDC today!
