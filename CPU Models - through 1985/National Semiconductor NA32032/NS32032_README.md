# NS32032 CPU Queueing Model

## Executive Summary
The NS32032 (1984) was National Semiconductor's **attempt to fix the NS32016's problems**. It added a full 32-bit bus and fixed many bugs. But by 1984, the market had already chosen the 68020 and x86. It was **too little, too late**.

## Technical Specifications
| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Year | 1984 |
| Data Bus | **32-bit** (vs 16) |
| Clock | 10+ MHz |
| Bugs | Fixed (mostly) |
| Market | **Still failed** |

## Improvements Over NS32016
- Full 32-bit external bus
- Many bug fixes
- Better performance
- More reliable

## Why It Still Failed
1. **1984 was too late** - 68020 already shipping
2. **Trust destroyed** - NS32016 had burned customers
3. **No ecosystem** - Developers had moved on
4. **Competition too strong** - 68020 and 80386 coming

## The Lesson
**You can't recover from a bad first impression.** National Semiconductor's 32-bit line never recovered from the NS32016 disaster.
