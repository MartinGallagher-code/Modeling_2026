# ARM2 - Project Summary

## Overview
First production ARM processor (1986). Powered the Acorn Archimedes.

## Key Specifications
- **Transistors:** 30,000
- **Clock:** 8-12 MHz
- **Pipeline:** 3 stages
- **IPC:** ~0.70
- **MIPS:** ~4.5 @ 8 MHz

## Improvements Over ARM1
1. Hardware multiplier (8 cycles vs 16)
2. Coprocessor interface (FPA10 FPU)
3. SWP instruction (atomic swap)
4. Higher clock speeds
5. Production-ready

## Performance (1987)
ARM2 was 5-6× faster than the 68000 used in Amiga/Atari ST/Mac!

## Acorn Archimedes
- Fastest personal computer of its time
- Dominated UK education market
- RISC OS operating system
- Technical triumph, limited commercial success outside UK

## Historical Significance
Proved ARM's real-world superiority. Technical lessons informed later mobile success.
