# Intel iAPX 432 Model Handoff

## Current Status
- **Validation**: PASSED
- **CPI Error**: 3.5%
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-28

## Current Model Summary
- Architecture: 32-bit capability-based object-oriented (multi-chip)
- Year: 1981
- Clock: 8.0 MHz
- Target CPI: 50.0
- Instruction categories: typical, compute, memory, control, mixed

## Known Issues
- None - model validates within 5% error

## Suggested Next Steps
- Add more workload profiles for specific use cases if needed
- Refine cycle counts if better documentation found

## Key Architectural Notes
- The Intel iAPX 432 was an ambitious capability-based architecture that failed due to poor performance.
- Its hardware-enforced object capabilities made it 5-10x slower than the simpler 8086, leading Intel to focus on x86.
