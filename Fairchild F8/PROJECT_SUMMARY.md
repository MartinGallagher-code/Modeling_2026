# Fairchild F8 - Project Summary

## Overview
First microcontroller-like architecture (1974) with 64 bytes on-chip RAM.

## Key Results
- **IPC:** ~0.06
- **Innovation:** First on-chip RAM (64 bytes)
- **Problem:** Multi-chip complexity

## Historical Significance
- Pioneered on-chip memory concept
- Powered first ROM cartridge game console (Channel F)
- Influenced all modern microcontrollers

## Channel F Console
- First cartridge-based system (1976)
- 26 games released
- Lost to Atari 2600

## Lesson Learned
Good ideas need good implementation. On-chip RAM was right; multi-chip design was wrong.
