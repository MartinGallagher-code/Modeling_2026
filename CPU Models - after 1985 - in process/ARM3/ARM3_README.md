# ARM3 CPU Queueing Model

## Executive Summary
The ARM3 (1989) was the **first ARM processor with on-chip cache**. Its 4KB unified cache made it approximately 3× faster than the ARM2 at the same clock speed. It proved ARM architecture could scale with modern memory systems.

## Technical Specifications
| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Year | 1989 |
| Cache | **4 KB** (first!) |
| Clock | 25-36 MHz |
| Pipeline | 3 stages |
| Transistors | 300,000 |

## vs ARM2
| Feature | ARM2 | ARM3 |
|---------|------|------|
| Cache | None | **4 KB** |
| Clock | 8-12 MHz | **25-36 MHz** |
| Performance | Baseline | **3×** |

## Significance
- First cached ARM
- Proved ARM could scale
- Bridge to modern ARM6
- Enabled faster Archimedes systems

## Used In
- Acorn A5000
- Archimedes upgrade cards
- Some embedded systems
