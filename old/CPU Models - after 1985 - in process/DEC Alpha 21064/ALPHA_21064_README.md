# DEC Alpha 21064 CPU Queueing Model

## Executive Summary
The DEC Alpha 21064 (1992) was the **fastest microprocessor in the world** when released. At 150+ MHz when Pentiums ran at 66 MHz, it was in a class of its own. Also the first true **64-bit RISC microprocessor**.

## Technical Specifications
| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Year | 1992 |
| Word size | **64-bit** |
| Clock | 150-300 MHz |
| Pipeline | 7 stages |
| Issue width | 2 |
| Transistors | 1,680,000 |

## Performance (1992)
| Benchmark | Alpha 21064 | Pentium-66 |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Clock | **150 MHz** | 66 MHz |
| SPECint92 | **125** | 65 |
| SPECfp92 | **180** | 63 |

**Over 2× faster than Pentium!**

## 64-Bit Pioneer
```
First true 64-bit microprocessor:
- 64-bit registers
- 64-bit data path
- 43-bit virtual address (8 TB)
- 34-bit physical address (16 GB)

Proved 64-bit was practical.
```

## Tragic Fate
```
1992: Alpha launches, world's fastest
1995: 21164 hits 500 MHz
1998: DEC acquired by Compaq
2002: Compaq acquired by HP
2004: Alpha discontinued

The best architecture doesn't always win.
```

## Legacy: AMD64
```
Many Alpha engineers went to AMD after DEC's demise.
They influenced AMD64 (x86-64) design:
- Clean 64-bit extension
- Similar register model
- Performance-focused

Alpha's DNA lives in every modern x86 PC.
