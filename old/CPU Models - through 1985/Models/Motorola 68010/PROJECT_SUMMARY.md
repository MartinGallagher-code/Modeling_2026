# Motorola 68010 - Project Summary

## Overview
Enhanced 68000 with virtual memory support and loop mode (1982).

## Key Results
- **IPC:** ~0.58 (8% faster than 68000)
- **Loop Mode:** 5× speedup for tight loops
- **VM Support:** Enabled Unix workstations

## Historical Significance
- Bridge between 68000 and 68020
- Made 68k viable for Unix market
- Competed with Intel 80286

## Lesson Learned
Adding one critical feature (VM support) can be more valuable than large performance gains.
