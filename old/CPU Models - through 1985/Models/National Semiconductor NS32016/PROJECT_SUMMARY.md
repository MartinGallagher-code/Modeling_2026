# NS32016 - Project Summary

## Overview
First commercial 32-bit microprocessor (1982) - a spectacular failure.

## Key Results
- **Claimed IPC:** ~0.40
- **Actual IPC:** ~0.10 (after bug workarounds)
- **Market Share:** Near zero
- **Lesson:** Working silicon > best architecture

## What Went Wrong
1. Severe silicon bugs requiring workarounds
2. Two years late to market
3. Slower than competing 16-bit 68000
4. Zero ecosystem support

## Historical Significance
The most important failure in microprocessor history. Proves that:
- "First" means nothing if broken
- Customer trust is fragile
- Marketing ≠ engineering

## Files
- `ns32016_model.py` - Python implementation (includes bug penalty)
- `ns32016_model.json` - Configuration
- `NS32016_README.md` - Full documentation
- `QUICK_START_NS32016.md` - Quick reference
