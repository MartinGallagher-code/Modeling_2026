# Signetics 2650 - Project Summary

## Overview
Innovative but limited 8-bit processor (1975) with 15-bit addressing.

## Key Results
- **IPC:** ~0.06
- **Fatal Flaw:** 32KB max memory (15-bit address)
- **Competitors:** 64KB (8080, 6502, 6800)

## Historical Significance
- Popular in European game consoles (VC 4000 family)
- Demonstrates importance of address space
- Cautionary tale about architectural limitations

## Why It Failed
1. 32KB ceiling couldn't grow with applications
2. Weak ecosystem vs 8080/6502
3. European focus missed larger US market
4. Unusual architecture made porting difficult

## Lesson Learned
Don't artificially limit architectural capacity. Saved pins ≠ saved market share.
