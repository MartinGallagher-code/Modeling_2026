# Zilog Z180 CPU Queueing Model

## Executive Summary
The Z180 (1985) was the **enhanced Z80** with on-chip MMU, DMA, and serial ports. It extended the Z80 architecture into the 1990s for embedded applications.

## Technical Specifications
| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Year | 1985 |
| Address Space | **1 MB** (vs Z80's 64KB) |
| Clock | Up to 33 MHz |
| MMU | On-chip |
| Serial | 2 UARTs |
| DMA | 2 channels |

## Key Improvements Over Z80
- 1MB address space via MMU
- On-chip peripherals (UART, DMA)
- Higher clock speeds
- New instructions (MLT, SLP)
- More efficient instruction timing

## Applications
Embedded systems, modems, industrial control, point-of-sale terminals.

## Legacy
Extended Z80 ecosystem life by 10+ years. Still produced today.
