# Intel i860 - Project Summary

"Cray on a chip" (1989). Incredible peak, impossible to achieve.

## Specs
- 80 MFLOPS peak
- 20 MFLOPS actual (compiler)
- No pipeline interlocks
- 3 branch delay slots

## Why It Failed
Too hard to program. Compilers achieved 25% of peak.
Hand-tuning required for performance.

## Lesson
Usable performance > Peak performance
