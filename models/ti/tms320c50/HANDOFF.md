# tms320c50 Model Handoff

## Current Status
- **Validation**: PASSED
- **CPI Error**: 0.7%
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-31
- **Data Source**: Published benchmark data (external validation)

## Current Model Summary
- Typical CPI: 3.333
- Calibrated against real published benchmarks
- Correction terms fitted via system identification

## External Benchmark Data
- dsp_peak: 25.0 MIPS @ 50.0MHz

## Known Issues
- None significant

## Suggested Next Steps
- Model is well-calibrated against external data
- Consider adding additional benchmark sources for cross-validation

## Key Architectural Notes
- CPI measurements now derived from published benchmarks, not synthetic data
- System identification correction terms recalibrated against real targets
