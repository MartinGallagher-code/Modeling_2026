## 2026-01-30 - Initial model creation (Phase 9)

**Session goal:** Create initial grey-box queueing model for Dallas DS80C320

**Starting state:**
- No model existed

**Changes made:**

1. Created initial model based on architectural specifications
   - Set instruction categories from datasheet timing
   - Created workload profiles for typical use cases
   - Target CPI: 2.0

**What we learned:**
- Dallas DS80C320 (1993) is a 8-bit processor at 33.0 MHz

**Final state:**
- Model created, awaiting system identification
- Validation: PENDING

## [2026-01-31] - External benchmark data integration

**Session goal:** Replace synthetic CPI measurements with real published benchmark data

**Starting state:**
- CPI source: emulator/estimated (synthetic)
- Validation: based on self-referential data

**Changes made:**

1. Updated measured_cpi.json with externally-validated benchmark data
   - Source: published_benchmark
  - mips_rating: 3.0 MIPS @ 33.0MHz → CPI=11.00
   - Per-workload CPI derived using era-appropriate adjustment factors

2. Re-ran system identification with new measurement targets
   - Correction terms re-optimized via least-squares
   - CPI error: 24.00%

**What we learned:**
- External benchmark data provides honest validation targets
- Model error vs real benchmarks: 24.00%

**Final state:**
- CPI error: 24.00%
- Validation: NEEDS INVESTIGATION (against real benchmark data)
- Source: published_benchmark
