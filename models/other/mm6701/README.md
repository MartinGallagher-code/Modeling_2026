## Model Overview
The Monolithic Memories 6701 was a 4-bit slice ALU similar to the AMD Am2901. Built using bipolar Schottky technology for high speed, it featured single-cycle microinstructions, 16 general-purpose registers, and carry look-ahead support. It was part of the 67xx bit-slice family and competed with the AMD Am2900 family in the mid-1970s bit-slice market. Monolithic Memories was later acquired by AMD.
