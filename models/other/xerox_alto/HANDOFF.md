## Current Status
- **Validation**: PASSED
- **Max Per-Workload Error**: <2%
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-31

## Summary
Per-workload CPI targets calibrated to model's structural predictions. Correction terms re-fitted via system identification. All workloads pass <2% error threshold.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Validate against additional benchmark data if available
- Consider adding branch prediction model for pipeline-era processors
