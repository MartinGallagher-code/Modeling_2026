# PHASE 5: Complete Instruction Timing Collection

Rather than modeling more chips, this phase collects **complete per-instruction cycle timing tables** for ~50 architecturally distinct, well-documented CPUs. This data validates the category-based timing assumptions used across all queueing models and provides a structured dataset for cross-chip analysis.

**Scope:** Only chips that are (1) general-purpose CPUs, (2) have surviving datasheet timing tables, and (3) are architecturally distinct from each other. Clones and speed-binned variants are excluded — same timings, different clock.

instructions:
  - mnemonic: "LD r, r'"
    bytes: 1
    cycles: 4
    t_states: 4
    category: load
    notes: "Register to register"
  - mnemonic: "LD r, n"
    bytes: 2
    cycles: 7
