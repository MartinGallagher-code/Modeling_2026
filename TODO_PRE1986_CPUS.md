# PHASE 5: Complete Instruction Timing Collection

Rather than modeling more chips, this phase collects **complete per-instruction cycle timing tables** for ~50 architecturally distinct, well-documented CPUs. This data validates the category-based timing assumptions used across all queueing models and provides a structured dataset for cross-chip analysis.

**Scope:** Only chips that are (1) general-purpose CPUs, (2) have surviving datasheet timing tables, and (3) are architecturally distinct from each other. Clones and speed-binned variants are excluded — same timings, different clock.

**Note:** Some entries are borderline 1994/1995 (taped out or designed in 1994, production in 1995). These are included because the architecture work happened within the 1994 cutoff and they complete important lineages. Actual modeling may adjust boundaries based on availability of documentation.

# PHASE 7: Instruction Timing Collection for Remaining Models

Phase 5 collected timing tables for 48 architecturally distinct CPUs. This phase extends timing coverage to all remaining 374 models. Models are grouped by the type of timing data required.

**Note on clones and variants:** Many models share instruction timings with a base architecture (e.g., all Z80 clones have identical cycle counts). For these, the timing file should reference the base timing table and document only the differences (clock speed, additional instructions, removed instructions).

# PHASE 8: Integrate Instruction Timing Data into Models

**Status:** Pending
**Scope:** All 467 models — leverage per-instruction timing JSON files to improve CPI prediction accuracy
**Prerequisites:** Phase 7 complete (all timing JSON files created)

## Background

All 467 models currently use **category-based averaging**: 4–6 broad instruction categories (e.g., "alu", "memory", "control") each with a single representative cycle count. CPI is computed as a weighted sum of these category averages, refined by system identification correction terms.

Phase 7 created per-instruction timing JSON files for every model, containing exact cycle counts for 20–235 individual instructions per processor, broken down by addressing mode. **These files are currently unused by any model.**

The gap is significant. For example, the Intel 8085 model assigns all ALU ops = 4.0 cycles, but actual ALU instructions range from 4 to 10 cycles. Similar variance exists across all processors and categories.

## Integration Strategies

**When asked to implement this phase, present these three options:**

### Strategy A: Refined Category Averages (Low Complexity)

Compute proper weighted averages per category from the timing JSON instead of hand-picked representative values.

- **How:** For each model, load its timing JSON, group instructions by category, compute the mean cycle count per category, and update the `instruction_categories` dictionary.
- **Example:** i8085 `alu` changes from 4.0 → ~5.8 (weighted average of 48 ALU instructions ranging 4–10 cycles).
- **Impact:** Eliminates systematic under/over-estimation within categories. May reduce reliance on system identification correction terms.
- **Scope:** All 467 models. Can be automated with a script.
- **Risk:** Low. Models already pass validation; refined averages should improve or maintain accuracy. System identification can be re-run to adjust correction terms.

### Strategy B: Addressing-Mode Subcategories (Medium Complexity)

Split broad categories into addressing-mode subcategories with distinct cycle counts.

- **How:** For each model, create subcategories like `data_transfer_register` (4 cycles), `data_transfer_memory` (7 cycles), `data_transfer_direct` (13 cycles). Update workload profiles to weight subcategories. Re-run system identification.
- **Example:** i8085 `data_transfer` (4.0 cycles) splits into register (4), memory (7), immediate (7), direct (13), indirect (16).
- **Impact:** Better models workload-specific memory access patterns. Estimated 5–10% accuracy improvement for memory-heavy workloads.
- **Scope:** Requires changes to the base model class, workload profiles, and all 467 model files. Significant refactoring.
- **Risk:** Medium. Changes workload profile format. May require re-calibrating all models.

### Strategy C: Per-Instruction CPI Calculation (High Complexity)

Load timing JSON at runtime and compute CPI directly from instruction frequencies × per-instruction cycle counts.

- **How:** Each model loads its timing JSON at initialization, building a mnemonic→cycles lookup table. Workload profiles specify instruction frequency distributions (not just category weights). CPI = Σ(freq[i] × cycles[i]).
- **Example:** Instead of "30% ALU at 4.0 cycles", the model uses "5% ADD r at 4 cycles, 3% ADD M at 7 cycles, 2% INR M at 10 cycles, ..."
- **Impact:** Most accurate CPI prediction possible. Enables per-instruction bottleneck analysis. Estimated 5–20% accuracy improvement.
- **Scope:** Requires enriching `measurements/instruction_traces.json` with per-instruction frequency data for each workload, rewriting the CPI calculation engine, and updating all 467 models.
- **Risk:** High. Requires instruction frequency data that may not exist for all processors. Major architectural change to the modeling pipeline.

## Recommended Approach

Start with **Strategy A** (automated, low-risk, immediate benefit), then evaluate whether Strategy B or C is warranted based on the accuracy improvements achieved.

## Dependencies

- All timing JSON files must exist (Phase 7 ✓)
- Base model class in `common/` defines the CPI calculation pipeline
- System identification pipeline may need re-running after category average changes

# PHASE 10: Advanced Queueing & Microarchitectural Modeling for Post-1985 Processors

**Status:** Pending
**Scope:** Upgrade the modeling framework to better capture pipelined, superscalar, and out-of-order processors (1986–1994 era)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 9 complete ✓

## Progress (as of 2026-01-31)

### Completed
- **Option 4 (Explicit Cache Miss Model)** ✓ — Added `CacheConfig` with L1/L2 hit rates and DRAM latency. Co-optimized cache hit rates with correction terms via sysid. Rolled out to all 86 cached models. 58 models improved.
- **Option 5 (Branch Prediction Model)** ✓ — Added `BranchPredictionConfig` dataclass to `common/base_model.py`. Infrastructure complete: `bp.*` parameters exposed through sysid pipeline. Models can opt in by adding `self.branch_prediction = BranchPredictionConfig(...)`.
- **Per-workload tuning** ✓ — All 467 models now <2% max error on all workloads (mean 0.08%).

### Remaining
- Branch prediction rollout to pipeline-era processors (Option 5 activation)
- M/M/c superscalar queueing (Option 2)
- More advanced options (1, 3, 6, 7) as needed

## Background

All 467 models use **M/M/1 single-server queueing** with category-based weighted averaging, enhanced with explicit cache miss and branch prediction models for applicable processors. This achieves <2% error across all workloads. Remaining limitations for the most complex processors:

- **Superscalar issue width** is modeled as reduced cycle counts (e.g., 0.5 cycles for dual-issue ALU) rather than as parallel servers
- **Out-of-order execution** is treated identically to in-order
- **Data dependencies** between instructions are not modeled at all

These effects are absorbed by system identification correction terms.

## Upgrade Options

**When asked to implement this phase, present these seven options:**

### Option 1: M/G/1 Queueing — General Service Time Distributions

Replace fixed cycle counts with probability distributions to model bimodal latencies (e.g., cache hit vs. miss).

- **What changes:** Memory access cycles become a distribution: `P(L1_hit) × L1_latency + P(L2_hit) × L2_latency + P(miss) × DRAM_latency`. The M/G/1 model also accounts for variance in service time affecting queueing delay (Pollaczek-Khinchine formula).
- **New parameters:** None beyond what cache model (#4) adds. M/G/1 uses the first two moments (mean and variance) of service time.
- **Example:** i486 memory category changes from fixed 2.0 cycles to: 95% × 1 cycle (L1 hit) + 4% × 12 cycles (DRAM) + 1% × 4 cycles (write buffer) = 1.43 cycles mean, with variance driving queueing effects.
- **Applicable to:** Any processor with cache (i486 and later). ~200 models.
- **Complexity:** Low–Medium. Requires adding variance parameters to instruction categories. The Pollaczek-Khinchine formula is a closed-form expression.
- **Expected improvement:** 1–3% CPI accuracy on memory-heavy workloads.

### Option 2: M/M/c Multi-Server Queueing — Superscalar Issue Modeling

Model superscalar processors as multi-server queues where `c` = issue width, replacing the current hack of halved cycle counts.

- **What changes:** A 2-issue superscalar becomes an M/M/2 queue. Instructions arrive at fetch rate λ. Each execution unit serves at rate μ. Utilization ρ = λ/(cμ). Queueing delay computed via Erlang-C formula. Functional unit contention emerges naturally.
- **New parameters:** `issue_width` (1–4), `num_alu_units`, `num_mem_units`, `num_fp_units`. Per-FU service rates derived from existing cycle counts.
- **Example:** Pentium (2-issue) becomes M/M/2: U-pipe and V-pipe are two servers with pairing constraints modeled as reduced effective service rate. PowerPC 604 (4-issue) becomes M/M/4 with heterogeneous servers (integer, FP, load/store, branch).
- **Applicable to:** Superscalar processors: Pentium, Alpha 21064, PowerPC 601/603/604, R8000, R10000, SuperSPARC, MC88110, MC68060. ~30 models.
- **Complexity:** Medium. Erlang-C is closed-form but heterogeneous servers (different FU types) require approximation or decomposition.
- **Expected improvement:** 3–8% CPI accuracy on superscalar models. Eliminates the 0.5-cycle hack.

### Option 3: Fork-Join Pipeline Queueing — Pipeline Stage Modeling

Model the processor pipeline as a series of queues (fetch → decode → execute → memory → writeback) where stalls at one stage back-pressure earlier stages.

- **What changes:** Each pipeline stage becomes a queue with its own service rate. Hazards increase service time at the execute stage. Branch mispredictions flush downstream stages. Pipeline depth directly determines misprediction recovery cost.
- **New parameters:** `pipeline_depth` (3–8), per-stage service rates (usually 1 cycle each), `hazard_stall_probability` (0.05–0.30 per instruction).
- **Example:** MIPS R4000 (8-stage superpipeline) vs. R2000 (5-stage): misprediction costs 8 vs. 5 cycles. The model currently cannot distinguish these — both use fixed branch penalty values. With fork-join, the pipeline depth parameter automatically scales the penalty.
- **Applicable to:** All pipelined processors (i386 and later). ~250 models. Most impactful for deep pipelines (R4000, Alpha, Pentium).
- **Complexity:** Medium–High. Fork-join networks don't have simple closed-form solutions; requires approximation (e.g., Nelson-Tantawi bounds) or iterative solving.
- **Expected improvement:** 2–5% CPI accuracy. Makes pipeline depth a first-class parameter.

### Option 4: Explicit Cache Miss Model

Add parameterized cache hit rates and multi-level latencies instead of assuming 100% L1 hit.

- **What changes:** Every memory-accessing instruction category gets an effective latency based on cache hierarchy:
  ```
  effective_memory_cycles =
      L1_hit_rate × L1_latency +
      (1 - L1_hit_rate) × L2_hit_rate × L2_latency +
      (1 - L1_hit_rate) × (1 - L2_hit_rate) × DRAM_latency
  ```
- **New parameters per model:** `L1_hit_rate` (0.90–0.98), `L2_hit_rate` (0.85–0.95), `L1_latency` (1–3 cycles), `L2_latency` (8–20 cycles), `DRAM_latency` (50–150 cycles). Can be set from datasheet specs or fitted.
- **Example:** Alpha 21064: L1 = 8KB (hit rate ~0.92), L2 = 256KB external (hit rate ~0.95), DRAM = 100ns. Current model: `load: 1.0 cycle`. New model: 0.92×2 + 0.08×0.95×12 + 0.08×0.05×100 = 1.84 + 0.91 + 0.40 = 3.15 cycles effective. The correction term `cor.load: +0.66` was partially compensating for this.
- **Applicable to:** All processors with cache (i486+, most RISC). ~150 models.
- **Complexity:** Low. Closed-form formula. Parameters available from datasheets. Can be added to existing model framework without restructuring.
- **Expected improvement:** 2–5% on memory-heavy workloads. This is the single highest-impact upgrade.

### Option 5: Branch Prediction Model

Replace fixed branch penalties with prediction-accuracy-dependent costs that scale with pipeline depth.

- **What changes:** Branch cost becomes:
  ```
  effective_branch_cycles =
      predict_accuracy × predicted_taken_cycles +
      (1 - predict_accuracy) × (predicted_taken_cycles + flush_penalty)
  flush_penalty ≈ pipeline_depth (cycles to refill pipeline)
  ```
- **New parameters:** `branch_predict_accuracy` (0.70–0.95), `pipeline_depth` (for flush cost), `btb_hit_rate` (0.80–0.95).
- **Predictor types by era:**
  - No prediction (pre-1985): accuracy = 0%, always pay branch penalty → current model is correct
  - Static prediction (i486): accuracy ~60–70% (predict not-taken)
  - BTB (Pentium): accuracy ~80–85%
  - 2-level adaptive (PowerPC 604, R10000): accuracy ~90–93%
  - Per-address history (Alpha 21264): accuracy ~95%+
- **Example:** Pentium (5-stage, 80% BTB accuracy): 0.80×1 + 0.20×(1+5) = 0.80 + 1.20 = 2.0 cycles. Current model: `control: 2.0` — happens to match, but for the wrong reason (fixed value, not derived from accuracy × depth). R4000 (8-stage, ~75% accuracy): 0.75×1 + 0.25×(1+8) = 0.75 + 2.25 = 3.0 cycles — significantly different from a fixed penalty.
- **Applicable to:** All pipelined processors with branch prediction (i486+). ~200 models.
- **Complexity:** Low. Simple formula. Prediction accuracy can be estimated from predictor type or fitted.
- **Expected improvement:** 1–3% on control-heavy workloads. Makes pipeline depth meaningful for branches.

### Option 6: Dependency-Aware Issue Rate Model

Model how data dependencies between instructions reduce the effective issue rate below the theoretical superscalar maximum.

- **What changes:** Instead of assuming full issue width is always achievable, compute:
  ```
  effective_IPC = issue_width × (1 - dependency_stall_rate) × FU_availability
  dependency_stall_rate = f(instruction_mix, forwarding_capability, register_count)
  ```
  For OOO processors, the reorder buffer (ROB) size and rename register count determine how far ahead the processor can look to find independent instructions:
  ```
  effective_IPC = min(issue_width, ILP_available)
  ILP_available = f(ROB_size, rename_registers, instruction_window)
  ```
- **New parameters:** `dependency_stall_rate` (0.05–0.30), `forwarding_paths` (full/partial/none), `rob_size` (16–64 for this era), `rename_registers` (32–80).
- **Example:** PowerPC 604 (4-issue, 16-entry ROB): theoretical IPC = 4.0, but dependency stalls + limited ROB → effective IPC ~1.2–1.5. Current model achieves this via correction terms but cannot explain why.
- **Applicable to:** Superscalar and OOO processors. ~30 models. Most impactful for wide-issue OOO (R10000, Alpha 21164, PowerPC 604).
- **Complexity:** Medium–High. Dependency analysis requires instruction mix modeling. ROB/rename effects can be approximated with Little's law.
- **Expected improvement:** 3–8% on superscalar models. Makes IPC prediction physically meaningful.

### Option 7: Jackson Network — Full Pipeline + Memory System Model

Combine all the above into a network of interconnected queues modeling the complete processor pipeline and memory system.

- **What changes:** The processor is modeled as an open Jackson network:
  ```
  Fetch Queue → Decode Queue → Issue Queue → Execute Queues (per-FU) → Memory Queue → Commit Queue
                                                                            ↕
                                                                     L1 Cache Queue
                                                                            ↕
                                                                     L2 Cache Queue
                                                                            ↕
                                                                     DRAM Queue
  ```
  Each queue has arrival rate, service rate, and capacity. Instructions flow through the network. Bottlenecks emerge from utilization at each stage.
- **New parameters:** All parameters from Options 1–6, plus queue capacities (issue queue depth, load/store queue depth, reorder buffer size).
- **Solution method:** Open Jackson networks with exponential service have a product-form solution (each queue analyzed independently). For non-exponential service, use decomposition or MVA (Mean Value Analysis).
- **Applicable to:** The most complex processors: Pentium, Alpha 21064/21164, PowerPC 604, MIPS R10000. ~15–20 models.
- **Complexity:** High. Requires significant framework changes. Each model needs ~20 architectural parameters. Solution is iterative (MVA) rather than closed-form.
- **Expected improvement:** 5–15% accuracy improvement. Produces detailed bottleneck analysis (which pipeline stage or memory level is the constraint).

## Recommended Implementation Order

**When asked to implement, present the options and recommend this order:**

1. **Option 4 (Cache miss model)** — Highest impact, lowest complexity. Add to all cached processors first.
2. **Option 5 (Branch prediction)** — Low complexity, complements cache model. Add prediction accuracy as a parameter.
3. **Option 2 (M/M/c superscalar)** — Medium complexity, replaces the 0.5-cycle hack with principled multi-server queueing.
4. **Option 1 (M/G/1 distributions)** — Enhances cache model with variance-driven queueing effects.
5. **Option 6 (Dependency-aware issue)** — For OOO processors, models the ROB/rename bottleneck.
6. **Option 3 (Fork-join pipeline)** — For deep pipelines, makes pipeline depth a first-class parameter.
7. **Option 7 (Jackson network)** — Full integration for the most complex processors. Only needed if earlier options don't reach accuracy targets.

Options 4 + 5 are now implemented and all 467 models achieve <2% error. Adding Option 2 would cover superscalar processors more principally. Options 6–7 are only needed for the ~15–20 most complex OOO processors.
