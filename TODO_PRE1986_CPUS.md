# PHASE 5: Complete Instruction Timing Collection

Rather than modeling more chips, this phase collects **complete per-instruction cycle timing tables** for ~50 architecturally distinct, well-documented CPUs. This data validates the category-based timing assumptions used across all queueing models and provides a structured dataset for cross-chip analysis.

**Scope:** Only chips that are (1) general-purpose CPUs, (2) have surviving datasheet timing tables, and (3) are architecturally distinct from each other. Clones and speed-binned variants are excluded — same timings, different clock.

## Deliverable Format

For each chip, collect a structured table:

```
processor: z80
source: "Z80 CPU Technical Manual, March 1976, Table 8"
instructions:
  - mnemonic: "LD r, r'"
    bytes: 1
    cycles: 4
    t_states: 4
    category: load
    notes: "Register to register"
  - mnemonic: "LD r, n"
    bytes: 2
    cycles: 7
    t_states: 7
    category: load
    notes: "Immediate to register"
  ...
```

Store as YAML or JSON in a new `timing/` directory per processor.

# TASK: Add Architecture Documentation to All Models

**Status:** Pending
**Scope:** 157 models are missing or have empty `docs/` directories

Each model should have architecture documentation in its `docs/` subdirectory covering:
- Processor overview (manufacturer, year, architecture type, word size, clock speed)
- Instruction set summary (categories, addressing modes, notable instructions)
- Pipeline/execution model details
- Memory architecture (bus width, cache, address space)
- Key datasheet references and sources
